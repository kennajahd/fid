  <h1>Inline Elements in HTML</h1>

  <p>
    Inline elements are used to mark up text within a paragraph without
    breaking the flow of the content. For example, the <em>em</em> element
    indicates emphasis, while the <strong>strong</strong> element indicates
    strong importance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by
    <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>, and it relies heavily on
    <code>HTML</code> to structure content.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also use the <q>q</q> element to mark up short quotations,
    such as <q>HTML gives structure to content</q>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chemical formulas like H<sub>2</sub>O use the <sub>sub</sub> element,
    while math expressions such as x<sup>2</sup> use the <sup>sup</sup>
    element.
